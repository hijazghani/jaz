  <h2>Who are we ?</h2>
  <p id="text3">  We are HADYOUTFITS company. We attach great importance to the quality of the website produced so that the customers who use our website are satisfied and give good feedback while raising the name of our company to be better and known by many. We created a website about local clothes in Malaysia and gathered them in one platform to make it easier for customers to find local items. Our company hopes that by doing this project, our company will be known to many people and will be able to raise the name of local brands that are in Malaysia and not known to many people. We also hope that our company can make Malaysians aware of local goods, especially related to clothing and fashion enthusiasts. This project can solve the problem of customers who are confused to choose local fashionable clothes and help promote local brands that are difficult for the public to recognize.</p>
